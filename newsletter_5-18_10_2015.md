[Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) is a site where you can find local groups of people who are interested in similar topics.  It is useful site to find people who are interested in languages, specific art forms, and of course...programming. Most of the activities are free, but groups do occasionally have workshops that they charge admission to.

Two upcoming events may be of interest to you:
* [Monday and Tuesday Oct 26/27, Intro to jQuery (2-Day Workshop)](http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Ann-Arbor/events/225672940/)

	This is a workshop on jQuery.  It requires a registration fee.

* [Wednesday Nov 11th, WP Ann Arbor Work Session](http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Ann-Arbor/events/225575359/)

	Show up to work on your WordPress site, get help with your site, help others, or just chat with other local WordPress users.
